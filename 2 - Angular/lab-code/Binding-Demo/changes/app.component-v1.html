<h1> My first Angular app </h1>

<!-- The context for all the names in the template expressions
below is the root component -->

<!-- Referencing the myLocation property in the component -->
<h2> This app is hosted in {{ myLocation }} </h2>

<!-- Calling a standard JavaScript method in the template expression -->
<h3> {{ myLocation.toUpperCase() + " is a great place"}} </h3>

<!-- Referencing the getMoreLanguages method in the component -->
<p> There are {{2 + 1}} languages that I like: {{ 'Python, ' + getMoreLanguages()}}</p>

<!-- When there are strings present in the template expression
and concatenation occurs, any numeric operands present as well
are autoconverted to strings  -->
<p> {{ "Incorrect addition : " +  2 + 3 }} </p> 

<!-- In such a situation, we will need to put parenthesis around
  anything that we want evaluated as a proper mathematical 
  expression -->
<p> {{ "Correct addition : " +  (2 + 3) }} </p> 

<!-- We don't normally use interpolation to assign values to element 
attributes as in the two examples below, instead we will use property binding -->

<!-- Notice that the entire string concatenation operation is provided
as a template expression within the {{}} -->
